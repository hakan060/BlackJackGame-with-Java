We shuffled 104 cards in a blackjack game. First of all, we compiled the code for the game in such a way that the cards are randomly distributed, we made sure that if the dealer's score is greater than 17, he/she should not draw cards, he/she to choose stay(S). In the second option, we have written the necessary codes so that the user can select the next card in the order he/she wants. The user can choose up to 11 cards according to the rules of the game.
